# Intro Lab Goals

This Lab is intended to get you started with using the CSCS infrastructure and to resolve eventual technincal issues before the lectures.

2) Launch a JupyterLab session
  - Login here: https://jupyter.cscs.ch

    - We don’t have a reservation on Piz Daint today, so this might take a few minutes.
