# octree-miniapp

Demonstration of octree construction on CPUs and GPUs for 3D point clouds.
This is a simplified version of the code found here: [Cornestone Octree](https://github.com/sekelle/cornerstone-octree).
Includes neighbor searches as an example application for the constructed octrees.

## Main features and methods
* Octrees represented based on Space-Filling-Curves (SFCs). Here, we use 3D-Hilbert curves.
* Performance portable octree construction on CPUs and GPUs based on common building blocks such
as radix sort and prefix sums as described in [1].
* Portable neighbor search implementation
* Warp-level optimized neighbor search for the GPU

```

## Compilation and running the mini-apps
* Major dependencies: Thrust (ships with the CUDA Toolkit)
* HIP support for AMD devices: yes, after hipifying the sources.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=<60,70 or 80> <THIS_REPO_GIT_SOURCE_DIR>
make -j

# running the mini-apps
./neighbor_search
```
All executables are single-source, therefore you may also compile them directly on the command line, e.g.:
```bash
nvcc neighbor_search.cu -O3 -std=c++17 -Xcompiler -fopenmp --gpu-architecture=compute_<60,70 or 80> neighbor_search.cu
```
